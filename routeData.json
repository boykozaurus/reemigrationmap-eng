In 1945, he was arrested and spent eight years in gulag camps, among them in Kazakhstan, serving time in the Ekibastuz forced labor camp. After his release in 1956, he continued his literary pursuits, denouncing the Stalinist regime. He was expelled from the USSR in 1974 and lived in the United States, but returned to Russia in 1994.",

In February 1923, Moshe Weissben was arrested in Kyiv and sentenced to a five-year banishment overseas. In 1925, he emigrated to Mandatory Palestine and continued his active political work. However, in 1927, at the request of the CSP leadership, Weissben illegally entered the USSR to rebuild the party's organizational structure. In 1929, Weissben was arrested and convicted of espionage and smuggling. He served his three-year sentence in the Solovetsky Special Purpose Camp, where he contracted pulmonary tuberculosis. After his release, Weissbein resumed his political work in the CSP. He took part in drawing up the new party program, only to be re-arrested in 1937. Seven months later, on April 19, 1938, Moshe Weisbein died of tuberculosis in the hospital of Lukyanovsky prison (Kiev)."

He was born in Chernihiv province and studied medicine at the University of Bern (Switzerland). In 1912, he settled in Harbin (Manchuria), where he was chairman of the Harbin Jewish community until 1945. In 1937, he founded and headed the National Council of Jewish Communities of the Far East, assisting Jews fleeing to China from Europe. From 1921-1943, he was editor of the Russian-language weekly magazine “Jewish Life,” the weekly “Siberia-Palestine,” and the newspaper “Jewish Vestnik.” He was the chief physician at the Jewish hospital which he established. In 1945, after the Red Army occupied Harbin, Kaufman was arrested and transported to the USSR, charged with espionage and Zionist activity. In 1948, he was sentenced to 25 years imprisonment. Kaufman continued to work as a doctor in the labor camps. He was released in 1956 and was ordered to settle in Karaganda, Kazakhstan. In 1961, he emigrated to Israel with his son Theodore. He continued to work as a doctor and also wrote memoirs and works about the history of Jewish communities in the Far East. Kaufman recounted his years in the USSR in his book “The Camp Doctor.”"

In 1937, he entered the Sorbonne. During the war, he fought in the British army, and in 1947, he came, as a supporter of the communist idea, to the Soviet Union. In October 1947, Friedman attempted to flee illegally to Romania but was arrested by a border guard unit and sentenced to a year in corrective labor camps. After serving his sentence, he came to live in Berdychiv. In 1950, a form case was opened on him as an alleged participant in the Zionist underground. After Stalin's death, Friedman's case was closed. He worked in Berdichev as a foreign language teacher; he knew English, French, Spanish, Farsi, Hebrew, and Yiddish. In 1961, he defended his dissertation. In the 1980s, he returned to France."
